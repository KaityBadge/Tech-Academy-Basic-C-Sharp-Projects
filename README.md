# Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

These are some of the small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

## Projects:

- ### CarInsuranceApproval
This is an MVC web application that displays car insurance quotes. This app takes user input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. You can navigate to /Insuree to find the list of Insurees and create a new one. I also created an admin page that allows administration to view all the insurance quotes in the database with options to edit and delete subjects. 

- ### PackageShippingQuote
This is a console application the takes user input and calculates a shipping quote. There is not MVC action here, like you would find in the CarInsuranceApproval application. This application uses if and else statement to determine a decimal value of how much it will cost to ship their package based off of policy standards. 

- ### TwentyOne
This is a console application that is designed to replicate the casino game of 21 or Black Jack. This app welcomes you to the Grand Hotel and Casino! It takes user input on whether or not they would like to play a game of 21. This app uses try and catch block to determine if the player is being fraudulent, it uses boolean logic to fix unhandles exceptions, uses SQLQuery to update/interact with the database.  

- ### NewsLetterSignUp
This is an MVC web application for users to sign up to receive the newsletter. This applicaiton is a simple sign up form created with HTML Form methods and basic html code combined with C# for format and design the form. Creatively using SQL to connect to the database by wrapping the connection in its own using statement to prevent SQL injections. I've also created an Admin page to display all of the signups, this is found by navigating to /Home/Admin.
