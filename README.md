# C# & .NET Framework Projects
This repo showcases several small projects I've developed using C# and the .NET Framework, including both MVC web applications and console applications. Each project demonstrates core programming concepts such as user input handling, business logic implementation, exception management, and database interaction.

üíæ##Projects Included:

A console-based simulation of the classic casino game Blackjack (21), themed as a virtual visit to the "Grand Hotel and Casino"
**Features:**
- Interactive gameplay with user input prompts
- Fruad detection using try/catch blocks
- Boolean logic for exception handling and flow control
- SQL integration for loggin player activity and game data
